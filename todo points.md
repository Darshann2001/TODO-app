There are several features and improvements you can add to enhance your todo app:

Update and edit todos: Allow users to edit existing todos instead of just adding and deleting them.

Mark todos as completed: Implement a feature to mark todos as completed, with the ability to filter and view completed and incomplete todos separately.

Categories or tags: Allow users to categorize todos with tags or categories, making it easier to organize and manage different types of tasks.

Due dates and reminders: Enable users to set due dates and reminders for todos, so they can stay on track and receive notifications for upcoming tasks.

Priority levels: Implement a feature to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to todos, helping users prioritize their tasks more effectively.

Search functionality: Add a search bar to allow users to search for specific todos by keyword or title.

Sorting options: Provide sorting options to sort todos by different criteria such as due date, priority, or category.

Dark mode: Implement a dark mode theme option for users who prefer a darker interface.

User authentication: Add user authentication to allow users to create accounts, sign in securely, and sync their todos across multiple devices.

Data synchronization: Implement data synchronization across devices using a backend service like Firebase or your own server.

Analytics: Track user interactions and usage patterns using analytics tools to gain insights into how users are using your app and identify areas for improvement.

Localization: Support multiple languages and locales to make your app accessible to users worldwide.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. Depending on your app's target audience and use cases, you can choose to implement one or more of these features to make your todo app more robust and user-friendly
